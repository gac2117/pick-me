# Pick Me!

This is a Rails API application that I made for my React-Redux portfolio project. I got the idea for this project through a friend who had a hard time picking restaurants to go eat at and wished there was an app that will do it for her. This application will allow the users to enter their favorite restaurants into the database and compile a list of restaurants. Then at a click of a button, one restaurant will be randomly chosen from the list and displayed on the screen. 

## Installation
1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. `cd` into the local repo you just cloned.
4. Run `bundle install` while in the root directory.

## Usage
1. Run `rake db:migrate` to set up the tables.
2. Run `rails s`.
3. Navigate to the address and port given on the command line in a browser.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions.
