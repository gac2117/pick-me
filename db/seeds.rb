# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# crazyfire = Restaurant.create(name: "CrazyFire", location: "Leesville Towne Centre")
# asian = crazyfire.tags.create(name: "Asian")
# cheap = crazyfire.tags.create(name: "cheap")

# longhorn = Restaurant.create(name: "LongHorn Steakhouse", location: "Brier Creek")
# steak = longhorn.tags.create(name: "Steak")
# expensive = longhorn.tags.create(name: "expensive")

# waraji = Restaurant.create(name: "Waraji", location: "Duraleigh")
# japanese = waraji.tags.create(name: "Japanese")
# sushi = waraji.tags.create(name: "sushi")

# kims = Restaurant.create(name: "Kim's Restaurant", location: "Duraleigh")
# korean = kims.tags.create(name: "Korean")
